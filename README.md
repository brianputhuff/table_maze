## Description
A simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript maze generator.

## Use
Link the ```table_maze.js``` and ```table_maze.css``` to your HTML file. See example HTML file (```table_maze.html```).
In your HTML file, within script tags, call the **```aMazeMe(w, h)```** function.
Replace the ***w*** with an apporpriate width value, and ***h*** with an appropriate height value.

example: ```aMazeMe(33, 15);```

![Sample Screenshot](./table_maze_example-33x15.PNG);

Note: you can make the height be the same as the width by just entering the width argument alone.

example: ```aMazeMe(25);```

![Sample Screenshot](./table_maze_example-25x25.PNG);

Dimensions must be greater than 3, and must be odd. If an argument less than 3 is entered, the program will default to 3. If an even value argument is used, the program will increment by one to make it odd.

## Modify
You can modify the ```make_table.css``` file to make cells larger or smaller, and adjust their color as you see fit.
